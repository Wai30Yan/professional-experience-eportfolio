      During my internship I got to know people from different counties and was expected to work together as a team. There were six of us in my team and each of them have different technical background even though we are to work as a software engineering group. I was assigned to work on developing the user interface of the product with another teammate who had recently graduated. However, my colleague is not a native English speaker, so the language barrier was to be expected.

      My co-worker did not have much experience with the framework we were using. I recommended to watch some tutorials on YouTube. Due to language barrier, my co-workerâ€™s learning rate was slow. However, I was able to help him to speed up the learning process as we were expected to come to the office every week. I was happy to teach him patiently even when he had hard times understanding the techniques I was explaining.

      Initially, I did not force him to learn the framework very quickly. I let him learn in his own pace as I belief everyone has their own ways of learning. However, as someone who recently finished the course, I expected more from him. It was hard for me to accept the fact that after four weeks, my co-worker was still not understanding the most basic and common techniques of the framework which made me to do most of the project.

      Then, lockdown happened due to the outbreak, and we were forced to work from home. This really set back the rate of development process. It was harder to teach my co-worker how to fix the error he had over a video call. His lack of ability to understand what I was saying and the framework we were using really made me frustrated.

      When I realised, he was not going to be much helpful with the project, I asked another team member to assist with the project. The new co-worker is fourth year software engineering student, same as me. We were in the same class before. Luckily, the new co-worker managed to get familiar with the framework in a short period of time. He was able to contribute to the project better than expected.

      What I learned from this experience is everyone is fighting their own battles. I was really annoyed to be working with my previous co-worker as I had to teach him everything like teaching how to walk to a baby. But after witnessing how another co-worker learned the framework so quickly, I realised there will be people who are better than you or not as good as you at certain tasks. I am confidence if my new co-worker and I had to learn the same framework at the same thing, he will definitely outrun me. The best thing we can do when someone has difficulties learning something in a workplace is to be patient and show some compassion and professionalism.
